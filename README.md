# ag-grid-test
A test for AG_GRID

1- Download the source files.
2- In terminal: npm install.
3- In terminal: npm start.

The project contains implementation of React-Redux. Actions creators and Reducers are working fine and extracting the data from the server. An error is thrown as soon as I render the grid component: AgGridReact from "ag-grid-react". No sure if this is dued to not having an enterprise license. If I remove the AgGridReact component everything works as expected. I would be willing to explain my approach if further explanations are requested.
